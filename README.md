# Kotelculator
Simple GUI calculator using *python* and *tkinter*  
I made this project for training my *python* and *tkinter* skills and also to learn  
using of GitHub and Git tools.  
All commentaries are in the code.  
Also i drew the app's icon by myself.  
File Kotelculator is compiled into exe python code. The whole script is in the "Code"  
Folder.  

P.S. I will use gui style like **BMO** from "Adventure Time" :)
